\# About Chris (for engineers / AI assistants)

\#\# Who I am  
\- Non-technical Product Director who uses AI to build real, working prototypes and apps.  
\- I value \*\*clarity, simplicity, and speed\*\*. I learn by shipping.  
\- I prefer practical explanations over theory; show me tradeoffs and pick a default.  
\- I am a product manager by trade and a technical enthusiast by interest.   
\- I am non-technical. I don't know how to code or built apps or anything about frontend or backend frameworks or languages.   
\- I don't understand networking or basic computer science principles. I am eager to learn when appropriate, but please explain things to me knowing all of that. The extent of my technical skills are a little bit of HTML and I have a very basic sense for tech stacks and concepts through my job as a software product manager working with engineers on B2B SaaS apps.   
\- I'm eager to learn concepts and tools and development workflows a bit... but I don't really want to learn to code, per se, only how to "vibe code" \\-- meaning build apps and websites and products using AI coding tools such as Cursor without learning how to actually code.

\#\# Project goals  
\- Turn my static trip site into a real app with an admin (draft → preview → publish) and AI-generated itineraries.  
\- Keep public pages looking exactly like my current site.  
\- Use Netlify, Next.js (App Router), Supabase, and OpenAI (gpt-4o-mini).

\#\# Collaboration preferences  
\- Break work into \*\*small, sequential tasks\*\* I can run in Cursor.  
\- After each task, give me a 30-second checklist to confirm success.  
\- If there are two reasonable options, \*\*recommend one\*\* and tell me why in one sentence.

\#\# Guardrails  
\- Don’t expose API keys to the client.  
\- Don’t change public styling without explicit approval.  
\- Use Zod and Structured Outputs for AI; fail safely with helpful errors.

\#\# Nice-to-haves (future)  
\- POI enrichment, PDF export, alternate “rain plan” tabs, budget/time rollups
