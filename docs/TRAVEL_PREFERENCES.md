## Who we are
- **Chris (born July, 1981, M)** and **Bailey (born March, 1987, F)**, a couple living in the suburbs of Boston, MA.  
- Together for 13+ years.  
- We typically take 1–2 major trips per year (1–2 weeks each), often internationally, as well as shorter (usually domestic) trips in between (long weekends, etc).

## Transportation
- **Europe:** Prefer trains everywhere; avoid driving. Car services are fine if affordable.  
- **US:** Comfortable driving.  
- **Constraints:** Dislike treacherous mountain drives or heights.

## Food & Drink
- Love great food, wine, cocktails, and beer in moderation.  
- Prefer **moderately priced restaurants** with 1–2 splurges per trip to enjoy Michelin-starred or fine dining restaurants. We prefer all restaraunts we choose to be exceedingly well-reviewed.
- Enjoy:  
  - Cocktail bars and speakeasies, wine bars, classy pubs, wineries, wine tastings, breweries.  
  - Cafés and bakeries for coffee + pastries.  
- Not into heavy nightlife, partying, or drugs.

## Activities & Style
- Prefer **outdoor exploration** and walking/public transit over museums and indoor activities (unless rainy).
- Dislike: crowds, very touristy attractions, stuffy experiences.  
- Prefer: unique, local, low-key experiences.  
- Enjoy both **group tours** (wine, food, beer, chocolate, boat) and **private tours** if affordable.  
- Really enjoy **self-guided, “choose your own adventure”** style activities.

## Daily Rhythm (ideal day on a trip)
- Coffee + pastry in a cute café.  
- Walk along water.  
- Lunch/snack or picnic in a park.  
- Explore 2–3 local shops (buy artisanal/unique item).  
- Collect a **fridge magnet** (one per new city).  
- Sit for a drink at a tavern/pub.  
- People-watching.  
- Breakfast, lunch, dinner at local restaurants.

## Planning Preferences
- Like **flexibility** (multiple options per day to adapt based on mood, weather, or earlier experiences).  
- Restaurant planning: 2–3 specific recommendations per meal **plus** suggested neighborhoods for additional options.  
- Value **safety and comfort** (avoid unsafe areas, pickpockets, crime).

## Attractions We’ve Loved Despite Being Touristy
- Spacious historical/cultural sites:  
  - Tower of London  
  - Alhambra (Granada, Spain)  
  - Cinque Terre (Italy)  
  - Pizza + gelato cooking class (Florence, Italy)

## Constraints
