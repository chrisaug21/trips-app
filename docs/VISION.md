# Product Vision — Trip Planner

## Purpose
Turn static trip site at https://trips.chrsiaug.com into a **living travel app** where Chris (as an admin) can generate, review, edit, and publish itineraries with AI support, while visitors browse those  travel plans.

## Admin Experience (Chris)
- **Create, don’t compile.** Chris inputs a simple trip brief (destinations, dates, interests) and gets a structured draft itinerary.  
- **Control & confidence.** Inline edits, per-day regeneration, and rollback snapshots ensure AI outputs feel safe to use.  
- **Fast publishing.** A trip can move from idea → draft → published guide in minutes, not hours.  

## Visitor Experience
- **Familiar, beautiful guides.** Public pages must feel identical to the current site’s look and readability at https://trips.chrisaug.com. Also refer to style guide here: https://trips.chrisaug.com/trips-style-guide.html
- **Organized browsing.** Trips grouped as Upcoming, Current, and Past. Each trip page has a day-by-day narrative, map pins, and several overview sections to provide travelers inspiration and context for what to expect.  
- **Accessible everywhere.** Works well on phones (390px+) and tablets, as well as desktop web browsers; fast page loads thanks to static rendering.

## UX Values
- **Authenticity over noise.** Content should highlight authentic local flavor, food/drink, history, and cultural context. Tourist traps are less desirable.
- **Options, not overload.** Alternates and notes help adapt to mood/weather without overwhelming visitors.  
- **Relaxed pace.** Guides encourage balance — meals, walks, hidden gems, downtime.  
- **Trust.** Visitors know this is a real journey, not a generic AI blog.
