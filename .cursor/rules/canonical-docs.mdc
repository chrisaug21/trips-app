# Canonical Docs (read these when in doubt)
- `/docs/VISION.md` — product vision, desired user experience and UX values
- `/docs/ARCH_DECISIONS.md` — stack & UI choices (Public = Tailwind + DaisyUI; Admin = Tailwind + shadcn/ui).
- `/docs/PROMPT_TASKS.md` — step-by-step tasks to follow in Cursor.
- `/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md` — product scope, UX, acceptance criteria.
- `/docs/ABOUT_CHRIS.md` — how to respond to and work with me as the app creator and admin

# Notes
- When generating code or plans, **cite which doc sections** you followed and explain deviations briefly.
