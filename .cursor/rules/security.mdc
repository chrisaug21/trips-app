# Secrets & Auth
- **Never** expose secrets (OpenAI key, Supabase service role) to the client.
- Keep secrets in **Netlify environment variables**.
- Use **Supabase Auth**; only allow Chrisâ€™s email to access `/admin/*`.

# Database Access
- **RLS**: public read for published trips; writes require admin.
- All write operations run via server actions/route handlers.

# Abuse Controls
- Rate-limit AI generation endpoints (admin-only).
- Log server errors with minimal PII; no verbose AI content in client logs.
