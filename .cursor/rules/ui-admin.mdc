# Components & Patterns
- Use **shadcn/ui** for forms, dialogs, tabs, toasts, dropdowns.
- Tabs for `/admin/trips/[id]`: Overview, Geographies, Days (with Accommodation), Sections, Versions.
- **Inline edits** with server actions (optimistic updates).
- Provide clear **toasts** and inline **error** states for all actions.

# UX Principles
- Short, forgiving flows (wizard for new trip).
- Clear Draft vs Published state.
- Dangerous actions (delete/overwrite) require explicit confirm.
- Show **AI provenance** (model, prompt_version) where relevant.
